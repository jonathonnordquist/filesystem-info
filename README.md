File System Explorer
--------------------

This is a basic program which takes in a folder path, then searches it and all it's sub-folders finding all included files.  All code is contained in the executable file.  To run the file simply navigate to the location folder, then run ```./file_system_explorer file/path/here```; the output will then be displayed in the terminal.  For especially deep or large folders which contain deeply nested directories and lots of files the process can take some time to complete as it has to navigate the entire directory structure in a depth first pattern.  Should an erroneous file path be entered (one which does not point to a directory) an error will be displayed.

I chose to keep everything in a single file as that makes it simple to use and move around.  I also elected to not use any third party libraries or gems, again to simplify the usage.  The implementation uses Ruby's built in ```File``` and ```Dir``` classes to read the necessary information, and searches using a recursive approach.
